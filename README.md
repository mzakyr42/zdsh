# zdsh

zdsh is a dumb shell written in rust

TODO:

builtin command:
- [x] cd
- [x] exit
- [ ] ls
- [x] pwd
- [x] clear

features:
- [x] pipe
- [x] comment
- [x] multiline input
- [ ] completion
- [ ] multi process
- [ ] history
- [ ] variable

multiline input still imperfect

sorry for my bad english.
